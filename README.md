# Panel for ordering excursions

## About project
The aim of the project was to create the application, which can be used to order excursions. There are two panels - for clients and admin. In the application JSON Server, REST API and fetch() were used. 

## Features

      - client is able to order excursions and to confirm it after fulfilling the contact form
   - admin panel 
      - admin is able to manage excursions (modify, delete, add new)
2. Validation at every field
3. Excursions and clients orders are stored in a local database and retrieved using a local API (JSON Server).
